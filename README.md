# On a Personal Note 
I'm an Autistic polymath. My passions are sharing philosophies, inventions, and my journey on YouTube → @CodeandCourage

At 37, I'm authoring a book about this entire odyssey — guided by faith, fueled by a passion for helping others, and driven by a lifelong obsession with learning and mastering any field I touch.

Massive movie buff, TV addict, anime degenerate — if it's actually good, I've seen it multiple times and will talk your ear off about it.

Buddhist by philosophy. Hard determinist by conviction (and I'll die on that hill).

I'm very funny, ridiculously kind, and carry stupid amounts of empathy for people.

I trust the process.
I trust God.
And I believe what we do — and why we do it — truly matters.
