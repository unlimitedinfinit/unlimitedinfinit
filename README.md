# Joshua Abrams —  IT Engineer | Legal Advocate | Nonprofit Founder

From homeless at 18 to self-taught Senior Systems Engineer. I've supported Azure DevOps pipelines at **Microsoft Xbox**, managed FedRAMP environments at **Granicus**, and migrated enterprise systems at **Dell** & **LabCorp**.

Now, I'm the founder and CTO of [**Just Liberty Inc.**](https://truejust.org/), a (501(c)(3)) nonprofit charity where I single-handedly build and ship production-grade SaaS to empower the underrepresented.

## 🔥 Live Production SaaS (Built Solo)
These aren't tutorials. They are full-stack, production-grade platforms helping real people today.

| Project | Live URL | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Just Legal** | [**justlegal.truejust.org**](https://justlegal.truejust.org/) | A multi-tenant case management SaaS for indigent defendants and pro se litigants. |
| **Just Politics** | [**justpolitics.truejust.org**](https://justpolitics.truejust.org/dashboard) | A civic engagement platform with a value-alignment engine to help voters find their matched candidates. |

## 🚀 Core Competencies
My experience splits evenly between high-level systems engineering and full-stack product development.

## 📦 Open-Source Roadmap

* `legal-case-intake-form`: Reusable React Native form component for case intake w/ validation & PDF generation.
