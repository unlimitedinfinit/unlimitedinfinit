# On a Personal Note 
Just a cool guy who loves to code, invent, and share ideas. I’ve overcome plenty of obstacles, and now I live with purpose and empathy. 
My interests are all over the place: Physics and philosophy? Yes. Video games and anime? Definitely. Tarot and numerology? That too. 
I’m writing a book, staying motivated, and trying to be a light for others
