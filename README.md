# Joshua Abrams — @unlimitedinfinit
**Prodigy. System Architect. Legal Savant. Disabled Polymath. Genius & Guru.**
I'm Joshua Abrams — a self-taught engineer, legal strategist, and digital freedom fighter. Born into chaos, forged in adversity, and wired to disrupt broken systems. 
From surviving the foster care system and homelessness to single-handedly winning over a dozen civil lawsuits as a pro se litigant, I don’t just write code — I write history.
With over a decade of experience in IT infrastructure, cloud engineering, cybersecurity, and full-stack development, I specialize in building tools that empower the underrepresented. 
My projects fuse law, technology, and justice — including JustLegal, a revolutionary legal SaaS platform designed to help self-represented litigants fight back with clarity, organization, and constitutional firepower.

## 🧠 Just Legal — Full-Stack Legal Rights Platform

After months of grinding code, navigating court deadlines, and living off caffeine and instinct, I launched [Just Legal](https://justlegal.replit.app) [working on deployment to Render]— a production-grade, multi-tenant case management platform. No templates. No no-code bullshit. Just raw capability, typed end-to-end, and scalable by design.

> Think *Mr. Robot* meets *The Rainmaker*. But real. And built by someone who lived it.

## 🧬 Why My Code’s Private

Most of what I’m building is closed-source for now — not because there’s nothing there, but because **there’s too much at stake to open it before it’s bulletproof**.

If you want to see the architecture, logic, auth flows, or build process — you’ll have to earn it. This isn’t hobby code. This is litigation-ready, security-minded, production-backed infrastructure written under fire.

## 🎯 Why This Profile Exists

This isn’t a portfolio.  
This isn’t branding.  
This is documentation of **one of the most unorthodox, underdog, and unstoppable developers working today**.

No bootcamp. No VC. No cofounder.  
Just code, court filings, and complete systems — built by a man everyone expected to fail.
